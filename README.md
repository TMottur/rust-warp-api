## ðŸš€ Features

- RESTful endpoints for questions and answers  
- Nested answer routes (`/questions/{id}/answers`)  
- Upvoting/downvoting functionality  
- In-memory database using `Arc<Mutex<_>>`  
- Fully async with `Tokio`  
- Typed JSON parsing via `Serde`

## ðŸ›  Implementation Notes

- **In-memory storage**: `type Db = Arc<Mutex<DbInner>>`
- **Handlers** in `handlers.rs`
- **Routes** in `routes.rs`
- **Models** in `models.rs` using Serde
- **Thread-safe state**: shared between handlers using `tokio::sync::Mutex`
